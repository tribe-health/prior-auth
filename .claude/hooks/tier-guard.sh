# An earlier version matched .phase against milestone|release|certify, which no

# reachable unblock path. Read .status, and provide explicit opt-ins.

TIER VIOLATION — Tier 3 command outside a release gate.

  command: $cmd
  status:  ${status:-<unknown>}
  phase:   ${phase:-<unknown>}
  source:  $waypoint

Tier 3 runs at milestone, release, or certification. A release build during
implementation invalidates the incremental cache and pays full optimization
for code that is about to change.

Run the Tier 2 equivalent instead, or open the gate deliberately:

  PROMETHEUS_TIER3=1 <command>          # one command
  touch .kbd-orchestrator/tier3.allow   # this session; delete when done

Do not edit the waypoint to get past this — it is the position record, not a
permission switch.
