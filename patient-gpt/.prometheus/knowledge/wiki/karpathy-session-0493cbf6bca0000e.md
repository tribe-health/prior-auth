## Delta

I committed PatientGPT as `d9c84918` and pushed it to `origin/codex/web-case-to-letter-checkpoint`. The commit has only the `patient-gpt/` directory: 2,280 files, about 24 MB. That includes the project setup that was already there untracked (skills, agent definitions, research notes). The parent repo's other uncommitted changes (the runtime-architecture evidence, the knowledge-wiki edits) were left alone and are not in it.

Before committing I ran the checks again:
- The Rust workspace builds, and clippy is clean with warnings treated as errors.
- The web production build passes, and `flutter analyze` reports no issues.
- No `console.log`, `println!` or `dbg!` calls are left in.
- A scan for secrets found nothing, and nothing ignored such as `target/`, `node_modules/` or iOS Pods is included.
- `cargo fmt` found formatting differences in the Rust crates. I applied it, then rebuilt and re-ran clippy, both clean.

Two other things happened along the way:
- **Stale git lock.** A git lock file from 11:13 was blocking every git command in the repo. It was empty and nothing had it open, so I removed it.
- **Parent audit failure.** The parent `scripts/audit.sh` fails its query-cache check because it starts the checker with `python3`, and the checker only runs under `uv`. Run with `uv`, that check passes for both the parent `web/` and `patient-gpt/web`. I didn't change the parent script.

## Root Cause

No explicit root-cause section was captured; preserve this as a session record, not an inferred diagnosis.
